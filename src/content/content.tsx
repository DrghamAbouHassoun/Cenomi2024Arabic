      "Cenomi Retail has now entered a new era of ambition and clarity. The Company has reimagined how it operates, where it wants to grow and what it stands for. 2024 was a year shaped by conviction - a readiness to act decisively and reshape the business for long-term advantages. Every decision was anchored in purpose and every change brought Cenomi Retail closer to being the company it aspires to be.", 
      "نجحنا خلال العام الماضي في إعادة رسم رؤيتنا لأساليب عملنا، وتحديد وجهات نمونا، والمبادئ التي نرتكز عليها، ما وضع سينومي ريتيل على الطريق الصحيح نحو مرحلة جديدة قوامها الطموح والعزيمة والرؤية الواضحة. كان عاماً شكلته قناعتنا الراسخة، وترجمتْهُ جرأتُنا على اتخاذ قرارات حاسمة لإعادة هيكلة أعمالنا بما يحقق لها ميزة تنافسية طويلة الأجل، فكان لكل قرار نتخذه غايةٌ وهدف، وكل تغيير يقرّبنا من المكانة التي نصبو إليها."
    ],
    paragraph2: [
      "This transformation wasn’t incremental. It was foundational. Cenomi Retail recalibrated not only what it does, but how it does it - from the ground up. With sharper priorities and a simplified structure, the Company focused its efforts on initiatives that will drive a lasting impact. The result is a more agile business with the confidence and capability to lead, adapt and thrive in a fast-moving landscape.", 
      "لم يكن هذا التحول تدريجياً، بل كان تحولاً جذرياً وشاملاً، أعدنا من خلاله معايرة أسس أعمالنا ومنهجياتها. وبفضل تحديدنا لأولويات أكثر دقة واعتمادنا هيكلاً تنظيمياً مبسطاً، وجّهنا جهودنا نحو المبادرات التي تضمن تحقيق أثر مستدام. وكانت النتيجة كياناً تجارياً أكثر مرونة، يتمتع بالثقة والقدرة على الريادة والتكيف والازدهار في مشهد أعمال سريع التغير."
    ],
    paragraph3: [
      "As the Company moves into 2025, it is investing with intention, expanding with discipline and moving faster in the markets that matter. The foundation is set. The strategy is clear. Cenomi Retail is now - undeniably  sharper, leaner and ready for growth.", 
      "ومع انطلاقتنا نحو عام 2025م، نوجه تركيزنا على الاستثمار بعناية فائقة، والتوسع بانضباط وحكمة، والتقدم بخطى أسرع في الأسواق الأكثر أهمية وجدوى بالنسبة لنا. لقد تمكنا من إرساء أسس صلبة لأعمالنا، وباتت استراتيجيتنا واضحة المعالم. وبفضل كل ما تحقق وما بذل من جهود، أصبحت سينومي ريتيل اليوم وبكل ثقة، أكثر تركيزاً، وأعلى كفاءةً، وأتم استعداداً للنمو."

            with a clear objective: to prepare for disciplined, scalable growth.

            Transforming our store portfolio was a critical lever in this reset.

            our view that scale should be driven by productivity, not presence.
            Our flagship Zara store at Al Nakheel Mall is symbolic of this

            by a renewed investment in our people. As the business evolved, we
            prioritized workforce alignment to support new strategic goals. Key
            hires across eight countries ensured our store network remained
            operational and responsive, with 2,676 new employees recruited and
            85% of the workforce completing at least one training program.
            Targeted upskilling, particularly around new brand concepts and
            digital tools, helped drive operational performance, while focused
            communication and internal mobility initiatives sustained engagement
            during a period of significant change.

            Store staff turnover declined to 40% in 2024 from 70% the previous
            year, reflecting our strengthened retention efforts. Career
            development opportunities, improved onboarding and recognition
            programs across all markets helped foster a culture of belonging and
            resilience. In the Kingdom alone, 1,499 Saudi nationals were hired,
            underscoring our continued commitment to Saudization and local
            talent development. Meanwhile, broader initiatives across Jordan,
            Uzbekistan, Armenia and others enhanced team cohesion and maintained
            service quality during restructuring.
          </span>,
          <span>
            Our people strategy is closely tied to our broader sustainability
            agenda. In 2024, we continued to embed inclusive hiring practices,
            promote diversity and ensure fair employment conditions across our
            markets. Employee <span className="text-no-wrap">well-being,</span>{" "}
            from mental health to workplace flexibility, remained a key focus,
            and our cultural initiatives boosted employee morale. These efforts
            are just a sample of the overall push we are making to shape a
            stronger, more agile Cenomi Retail, prepared for the next chapter of
            growth.

            Looking ahead, Cenomi Retail will transition from a period of brand
            portfolio optimization to a new phase of focused expansion and
            operational scalability. Following the successful divestment of 24{" "}
            <span className="text-no-wrap">non-core</span> brands and a 34.6%
            reduction in total store count, our attention now remains focused on
            reshaping the store portfolio. This will involve targeted
            investments in renovating and expanding Tier 1 Champion Brand stores
            in <span className="text-no-wrap">high-traffic</span> locations,
            enhancing the customer journey and elevating{" "}

            upgraded layouts, fitting room technology and{" "}
            <span className="text-no-wrap">self-checkout</span> innovations. The
            renovation program will prioritize stores that offer both scale and
            strategic value, building on the encouraging results seen from
            flagship transformations such as Zara at Al Nakheel Mall.
          </span>,
          <span>
            Our broader objective in 2025 is to build on the efficiencies gained
            across the business. With a 31.6% reduction in net debt already
            achieved in 2024, the Company is{" "}
            <span className="text-no-wrap">well-positioned</span> to reinvest in
            growth without compromising financial discipline. We will continue
            to enhance operational performance by deepening our presence in key
            domestic and international markets, scaling{" "}
            <span className="text-no-wrap">e-commerce</span> initiatives and
            launching new formats that support profitable expansion. As we
